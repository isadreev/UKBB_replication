# Notes

## Running on bc4

Need to have snakemake running in a 'screen' session

To enter screen:

```
screen
```

to come out of screen, while it's still running

```
ctrl+a, d
```

to go back into screen

```
screen -r
```

to list screen sessions

```
screen -list
```

Setup the environment:

```
module add languages/anaconda3/5.2.0-tflow-1.11
source ~/.bash_profile
```
